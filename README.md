# City of Helsinki - Etusivu Drupal project

Etusivu is the front page of the hel.fi project, featuring elements like the global menu, news, and articles, which are
also used on other pages. Additionally, Etusivu offers alternative language options not available on other instances.

## Environments

NOTE: Change these according of the state of your project.

## Login to Drupal container

This will log you inside the app container:

## Instance specific features

Etusivu instance has quite a lot of unique features because it is used as a master data source in many features such as
global navigation and news.

### Custom node types

#### News item (news_item)

News items are mostly specific to the Etusivu instance, except for high school news on the KASKO instance. All other
news items and articles visible on other core instances are originally written in this instance and displayed on other
instances as external entities. These external items are displayed on the `news_list` paragraph that is not available
on this instance since the news items and articles are local entities here. News items are provided by the
`helfi_platform_config` modules `helfi_node_news_item` module.

#### News article (news_article)

News articles are listed among news items and they behave in similar way. News article is based on the news item
structureâ€š but has few distinct differences:
- Main image is required. Hero block is composed of this main image, title and the lead paragraph.
- You can't change the article to a updating news.
- News articles have their own top news article flow where news articles can be added.
News articles are provided by the `helfi_node_news_article` module.

### Custom paragraphs

#### Current (current)

The _current_ paragraph is a curated list of links with seasonal illustration that you can add to landing pages. You
can select the season from the `field_seasons` and it will change the illustration. The logic can be found in the
instances `hdbt_subtheme` preprocess [here](https://github.com/City-of-Helsinki/drupal-helfi-etusivu/blob/e2643195b8fc2989da835313c052ae533b8e0143/public/themes/custom/hdbt_subtheme/hdbt_subtheme.theme#L108). The background color of the paragraph is the secondary color of the
selected color palette of the node that the paragraph is added to.

#### Latest news (front_page_latest_news)

_Latest news_ paragraph lists six latest news and links to the news archive page or the "What's new" page. You can
select between two designs for the listing (minimal and cards). The links for the news archive page / "What's new" page
are hardcoded, and it is done in the view called `frontpage_news`. The minimal design links to the "What's new" page and
the card design links to the news archive page. The configuration is found from `views.view.frontpage_news.yml` and
the links are defined there for each display.

#### News update (news_update)

_News update_ is used on updating news items, and it can be referred to the `field_news_item_updating_news` field. This
is the only place it can be used, and it essentially contains the information of one update on an ongoing news story.
For example, if there is an updating news story about a soccer match, a new goal would be one news update. Every time
a new update is added the news item's publishing time is updated to use the latest updates time so that the news item
remains on the top of time based listings while updating. Because of this the publishing time on the node page is
altered to display the oldest news update time as the publishing time to give the readers more correct information. The
other views of the news such as the teaser still use the news item's normal publishing time however.

#### Top news (front_page_top_news)

The _top news_ paragraph lists the news items or articles that have been added to the top news/articles flow. The
selection of what to show is determined by the `field_listing_type`, and the paragraph can be added to landing pages.

#### News archive (news_archive)

The _news_archive_ paragraph provides the news archive search that can be added to landing pages. The news archive is
a React search that uses views listing (`news_archive`) as a fallback when JavaScript is not enabled. All React
searches are in the `hdbt` theme, so most of the related logic is also found there. The _news_archive_ paragraph has an
editable title and description.
- React search code can be found under the `hdbt` theme [here](https://github.com/City-of-Helsinki/drupal-hdbt/tree/main/src/js/react/apps/news-archive).
- Additional configuration for the React app is under the `hdbt_subtheme` theme function
`hdbt_subtheme_preprocess_paragraph` [here](https://github.com/City-of-Helsinki/drupal-helfi-etusivu/blob/dev/public/themes/custom/hdbt_subtheme/hdbt_subtheme.theme)
- Fallback view when JavaScript is not enabled can be found in the `/conf/cim` folder [here](https://github.com/City-of-Helsinki/drupal-helfi-etusivu/blob/dev/conf/cmi/views.view.news_archive.yml).
- **NOTICE:** The fallback view and RSS view retrieve data from the regular database, while the React application queries
the Elasticsearch index. This is because switching the view to use the Elasticsearch index as the data source limits
its ability to filter using URL queries, compared to the regular view. For example, queries in the format
`?tags%5b%5d=375` would no longer work out of the box, and the contextual filters would need to be added separately.

### Custom roles

#### Menu API (menu_api)

Role used for writing the global menu entities through the API.

#### News producer (news_producer)

User role limited to news item and article production.

### Global navigation

Global navigation refers to the common navigation elements that can be found on all the core instances. This instance
collects main navigation items from all core instances and serves them through an API as a collection. Additionally, the
common footer, header and language navigations are provided by this instance. See the `helfi_global_navigation` module
and [documentation/menu.md](/documentation/menu.md) for more information.

### Global announcements

From this instance, you are able to create announcements that are displayed on all other hel.fi core instances. Unlike
other instances, the announcement node form includes a `Publish on external site` checkbox that is used to create these
global announcements. Code related to the global announcements can be found in `helfi_global_announcement` under
`helfi_platform_config` and the configuration for the `Publish on external site` is in the conf/cmi folder of this
instance and the configuration rewrite is [here](https://github.com/City-of-Helsinki/drupal-helfi-etusivu/blob/e2643195b8fc2989da835313c052ae533b8e0143/public/modules/custom/helfi_etusivu_config/config/rewrite/core.entity_form_display.node.announcement.default.yml).

## Customizations

### Enabled languages

This instance, unlike other core instances, has more than the three main languages enabled. These additional languages
are referred to as alternative languages. There is also partial support for languages that are read from right to left,
indicated in the labels of paragraphs that support this feature. The labels are added to the configuration files of
each paragraph that support the alternative languages. For example `paragraphs.paragraphs_type.text.yml` in [here](https://github.com/City-of-Helsinki/drupal-helfi-etusivu/blob/dev/conf/cmi/paragraphs.paragraphs_type.text.yml).

Regarding this alternative language support there is a custom module called `helfi_alt_lang_fallback` that provides
menu and block fallbacks for the alternative languages. See more from the module itself [here](https://github.com/City-of-Helsinki/drupal-helfi-etusivu/tree/dev/public/modules/custom/helfi_alt_lang_fallback).

### News and article feed reordering with drupal/draggableviews

Drupal/draggableviews -module is used to allow content creators to reorder the `main news feed` and `main articles feed`
located in the front page. Adding content to the front page news feed can be done from node edit page by enabling
`Publish the news article in the top news articles flow` selection.

Draggableviews-module doesn't support translations out of the box and some patching has been done to get it working.
The initial feed ordering view was done in [this PR](https://github.com/City-of-Helsinki/drupal-helfi-etusivu/pull/103/files#diff-eac9bb841152af0a402bf0d14621ac75c98ff734db71f6a34a7156b9812346df)
- `langcode` column was added to draggableviews -database table.
- Query alter was created for views utilizing draggableviews to filter out content by language.
- Page preprocess was included to add custom styling to the admin interface of the view used to organize the items.
